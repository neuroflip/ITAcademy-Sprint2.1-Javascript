# ITAcademy - Sprint2

This repository implements the Sprint 2.1 
- Exercici 1.1: Arrow functions.

The project is a vite project with only javascript code that implements the exercises. The structure of the exercises is the next one:

 - each exercise has a directory that includes the solution 
 - inside each directory there is:
  - one *.js that implements a module exporting the functions from the exercise
  - one *.test.js that imports all the implemented functions in the module and tests them
 - /etc directory includes the screenshot for the README file


## Instructions to run the project

Clone the repository and run the tests:

```
git clone https://github.com/neuroflip/ITAcademy-Sprint2.1-Javascript.git

# Why this exercises include tests?

The reason is because this is the best way to check the functions or code to implement. This way we can ensure that the implementation works correctly based on the statement of the exercise.
